NEXT STEPS
For the future, there are several features I would like to add,nom such as
-redirect the posts to open to a seperate page where the user can see the full directions and ingredient list of each recipe
-add an update function to post so users can edit their recipes
-add a save function on posts so users can save their favorite recipes and access the folder on a separate page on their profile
-last, include a search feature so users can find certain recipes either by typing in keywords or the full name of the dish
